        Our visualization aims to help illuminate how terrorist attacks changed over the years, in addition to showing
        any trends that may appear. This is especially relevant considering different current events all over the world
        brought to light by modern social media and digital outlets. We recognize that this is a serious and sensitive
        topic that deserves to be analyzed, and wish to display the data in a neutral unbiased light without sensationalist
        purposes.

      There are a number of different sources that provided inspiration to this project. The visualizations themselves
      were heavily inspired by some previous studio work involving mercator maps, as well as a previous assignment that
      dealt with showing political leanings across the different states of the USA. In addition, a visualization linked
      from from database used influenced several decisions made: https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/.

      <p>
        Some questions we are trying to answer are what are some of the trends involving global terrorism attacks? Have
        the frequency of such attacks increased over the last couple of years? How have certain factors influenced such
        attacks? These questions have evolved over the project as we started to hone into what available data was
        available to us, as well as how much of the data we could process reasonably over the timespan of this project.
        For example, we started to notice how a vast majority of the terrorist attacks were of a smaller magnitude in
        comparison with the largest attacks which made the information more difficult to display on the map. This lead
        to the question of if most terrorist attacks are of those with smaller, unconnected backgrounds rather than solely
        dominated by large well known groups with a clear agenda. There were also a surprising number of countries with
        no recorded terrorist attacks at all, which made us wonder if this was due to lack of information from our
        chosen data set rather than there is actually no attacks in those areas.

        We retrieved our data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd">https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd</a>,
        then proceeded to process it both through Javascript and by manual cleanup in order to mold it into a usable
        format. We also utilized some available topojson and geo json for dividing up the maps by country.

      <!--What visualizations did you use to look at your data initially? What insights did you gain?
      How did these insights inform your design?-->
      <p>
        We initially went with a main map view with plainly plotted points representing where each terrorist attack
        took place. We were able to then observe how these points changed over the years. In order to add more information
        to our visualization, we then added scaling and colors, in addition to additional views. Some insights we gained
        were that we needed to use log scaling instead of linear scaling since the discrepancy between the number of attacks
        with smaller casualty numbers greater outweighed those with larger numbers of casualties. We also lacked visualizations
        to show general overviews by country, which we later added.

        Some different visualizations we considered were dynamic block charts, connected force charts, and many different
        variations of our final map based visualization (These can be viewed below). Our final design choices were made
        with the goal of displaying our data in the more efficient and clear way possible while at the same time making
        it interactive and dynamic. The user is able to choose a range of time in years or a single year to display data
        pertaining to those specific years, not unlike the brushing feature we implemented in class before. The user can
        also select a single country to get a summary of the data for that specific place. In addition, The color scheme
        was chosen to furthermore illuminate the differences in severity of each attack, and was labeled using a dynamic
        legend which redraws every time the slider is changed. Lastly, tool tips and additional visualizations (a bar
        chart and a bubble chart) were implemented to give the viewer another point of view for the data.

        Our final visualization can be broken down into several parts: (1) Main map view (2) Country Zoom view
        (3) Bar chart (4) Line chart (5) Interactive bubble chart. Corresponding images can be seen in the sketches and
        screenshots section of this process book above. The main map view serves to give an overview of recorded
        terrorist attacks in regards to the selected years, which can be manipulated by the user. The main map also
        implements tool tips, and each bubble can be selected to give a more detailed profile of that specific attack.
        The country zoom gives a closer, more detailed, summarized look into each country's attack record. The bar
        chart and line charts give additional perspectives on all of the data in a dynamic animated manner. Lastly, the
        interactive bubble chart allows the user to interact with the visualization, while displaying the information
        in the end.

      <p>
        Here were several suggestions made during the final round of user testing:
        (1) Add list modal view to places with more than one attack
        (2) A little confusing that circle radius indicates casualty number instead of total number of attacks in the region
        (3) Move supplementary charts tab and add map to somewhere more obvious
        (4) Perhaps add more map info (dotted lines for territory borders, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to time, we have discussed implementing several of these changes while keeping other original
        implementations based on priority. For example, we have looked into adding a loading icon in order to notify
        the user when the visualization has finished loading all the data (which is a lot!). Several typos and title
        changes were also implemented, along with several placement shifts due to the feedback we got.

      <!--What did you learn about the data by using your visualizations? How did you answer your questions? -->
      <!--How well does your visualization work, and how could you further improve it?-->
      <p>
        Using our visualizations, we learned that in terms of number of events, most terrorist attacks in recent years
        were in fact committed by religious or military groups, with one of the largest attacks being that of 9/11. Also,
        although the number of individual attacks seemed to have steadily increased over the years, the total number of
        casualties have fluctuated quite a bit. We also should be wary about the accuracy of our data in terms of missing
        entries, especially in earlier years. Our data could very be missing many attacks versus the reporting power that
        improved technology has offered us today. So overall, although there is the possibility of missing data, our
        visualization does serve to answer our original questions adequately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now a way that this visualization could further improve would be if the data set contained even greater information
        about attacks in years prior to 1970. This is since although Islamic terrorist groups are seen as a major
        perpetrator recently, there have been differing trends in the past in regards to the current events of those
        times. The maps could also be more detailed, with the possibility of adding capitals or border paths, which have
        in fact changed as countries split and merged. The map could even be translated into using an API such as Mapbox,
        which is also utilized by apps such as Snapchat and Facebook.
