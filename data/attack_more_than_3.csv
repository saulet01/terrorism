He proceeded to shoot and kill Robert and Elizabeth Steagall, a White couple staying in the hotel.  Essex then doused a telephone book with lighter fluid and set the Steagalls' room on fire.  Noticing the commotion, Essex was approached by Frank Schneider and Sherwood Collins, the assistant manager and general manager of the hotel respectively.  Essex shot and killed both managers in two separate incidents.  Essex then lit more hotel rooms on fire.  At this point, Essex began shooting at the policemen and firemen that approached the hotel.  He shot and killed Deputy Super Intendent Louis Sirgo, Patrolman Pail Persigo and Patrolman Philip J. Coleman Sr.  Twenty  others were wounded as well.  Finally, the police were able to force Essex to the roof of the building.

The assailant, identified as Roland James Smith (aka Aboudima Moulika), was armed with a .38 caliber revolver and a canister of paint thinner. He shot and wounded four people before barricading himself and others inside the building and starting a fire that destroyed the first floor of the building. Smith shot and killed himself, and the fire killed seven others who were trapped in the store. Smith had been among protesters picketing the store in an ongoing landlord-tenant dispute with neighboring stores, which some protesters viewed as racially motivated. Witnesses reported that Smith carried out the attack because he mistakenly believed that the owner of the store was engaging in racially discriminatory hiring practices.",Hostage Taking (Barricade Incident),Business,Black Nationalists,8,4
